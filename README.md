#UML for Drupal 7

Contains input for [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com) to generate [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) diagrams that document (parts of) [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) release 7.

UML is intended to be a modeling language which can be used to generate code.  The diagrams generated from this repository serve only as documentation.  The hope is that this documentation will be more readable than the existing text documentation.

To use the contents of this repository, [download PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/download.html) and install it on your computer, then give the `.puml` files as input to PlantUML to generate diagram image files.
